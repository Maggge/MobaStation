MobaStation is a open source project to create a full digital model railroad system.
Main goal of the project is to use only cheap, easy to get components that can easy assembled.

MobaStation works with the Z21-LAN-Protocol. So you can connect it as Z21 to model railroad control systems like rocrail, jmri(not tested yet) and others. You can also use mobile-apps like the official Z21 app.

For DCC we use the <a href="https://github.com/Maggge/DCC">Maggge/DCC</a>-Library wich is extracted from <a href="https://github.com/DCC-EX/CommandStation-EX">DCC-EX</a>-Library and slightly modified.

For accessories like turnouts, sensors and others we use the <a href="https://github.com/Maggge/MobaBus">MobaBus</a>-Library and XpressNet(not working yet) to connect Roco multiMAUS controller.
